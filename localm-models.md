# An Analysis of Public LLMs for In-Browser Use with transformers.js

## I. Executive Summary: The Landscape of In-Browser LLMs on Hugging Face

### 1.1. The New Frontier of Client-Side AI

The deployment of large language models (LLMs) directly within web browsers marks a significant and transformative shift in the field of artificial intelligence. This paradigm, known as client-side AI, is driven by a desire to overcome the limitations of traditional, server-based inference. The primary advantages include enhanced data privacy, as sensitive user data never needs to leave the client device; substantial reductions in latency, eliminating the network round-trip time required for server-side processing; and a notable decrease in server-side infrastructure costs. By offloading computation to the user's device, applications can scale more efficiently and affordably. At the heart of this movement is the transformers.js library, which serves as a pivotal bridge, enabling developers to run state-of-the-art models in a browser environment.1 The library achieves this by leveraging core web technologies such as WebGPU for hardware acceleration and ONNX Runtime for model execution. This report will provide a detailed and systematic analysis of the LLM ecosystem on Hugging Face, exploring which models are not only technically compatible with this client-side stack but also adhere to a "non-gated" access policy, which is critical for building truly seamless public-facing applications.

### **1.2. Key Findings Snapshot**

This analysis reveals a diverse landscape of models suitable for in-browser deployment, categorized by their access policies on the Hugging Face Hub. While technically proficient models from major vendors like Meta's Llama and Google's Gemma are compatible, their "gated" access—requiring a user login and explicit agreement to a license—creates a significant hurdle for developers seeking frictionless integration.4 In contrast, models from Microsoft’s Phi series and models maintained by community members like the Xenova organization offer a genuinely non-gated experience, allowing direct, unauthenticated access to files. This distinction is crucial, as a model's open-source license does not always guarantee open access to its files. Furthermore, the report finds that model performance is not solely a function of parameter count. Architectural innovations, such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and Sliding Window Attention (SWA), enable smaller models like Mistral 7B to achieve performance levels that rival and even surpass larger models from previous generations.7 The report also highlights a notable disconnect between the performance metrics cited in official model cards and the practical, subjective feedback from the developer community, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted evaluation approach.

## **II. Technical Foundations: The transformers.js and Hugging Face Hub Interaction Model**

### **2.1. The transformers.js and ONNX Runtime Stack**

The capability to run sophisticated machine learning models directly in the browser is a testament to the advancements in web technology and the open-source community. The core of this functionality is the transformers.js library, which serves as a JavaScript-based analogue to its popular Python counterpart.1 This library allows developers to use a familiar API to load and run pretrained models, abstracting away the underlying complexities of in-browser machine learning.

The engine that powers this client-side inference is ONNX Runtime. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard that defines a common set of operators and a file format for representing deep learning models.11 To be compatible with

transformers.js, models originally trained in frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow must first be converted into the ONNX format. This conversion process is typically performed using the Hugging Face Optimum library, which is designed to optimize models for faster inference, including quantization.11 The

transformers.js library then loads these ONNX-formatted model files into the browser.

A critical component of this ecosystem is the presence of dedicated community contributors, such as the Xenova organization.10 This group specializes in converting popular models to the ONNX format and hosting them on Hugging Face, effectively making them "web-ready" for

transformers.js users.13 This community effort addresses the logistical challenge of model conversion, a task that might otherwise deter developers from adopting client-side AI. The availability of a rich library of pre-converted models allows developers to rapidly prototype and deploy applications without needing to manage a server-side backend for inference.

### **2.2. A Taxonomy of Model Access on Hugging Face: Gated vs. Non-Gated**

The ability to use a model for in-browser inference depends not only on its technical format but also on its access policy on the Hugging Face Hub. A critical distinction exists between "non-gated" and "gated" models, a nuance that significantly impacts the developer workflow and end-user experience.

A **"non-gated"** model, as defined in this context, is one whose files can be downloaded directly from its Hugging Face repository without any form of user authentication or prior approval.6 This access model is ideal for public-facing web applications, as it completely removes a point of friction for end-users, who can begin using the application instantly without needing a Hugging Face account. Examples of models available this way often come from community projects like Xenova or are specific, developer-friendly releases from major vendors, such as the

microsoft/phi-1\_5 model.

In contrast, a **"gated"** model requires a user to be logged in to a Hugging Face account and explicitly agree to a license or set of terms before they can access the model files.4 This "gate" is a control mechanism used by model authors to track usage and ensure compliance with an acceptable use policy.6 Notably, a model's license and its access policy are independent. For example, a model can be released under a permissive open-source license like Apache 2.0 or MIT, yet still be "gated" by a mandatory click-through agreement on the Hub. This means a developer cannot simply use an open-source license as an indicator of direct access. For developers, a gated model necessitates an extra step in their workflow, such as instructing users to log in or using a programmatic access token for server-side deployments, which can be passed as a bearer token in API calls.8

The critical implication of this access distinction is that a developer building a public web application must choose a truly non-gated model to avoid imposing a mandatory login step on their end-users. The choice of a gated model, regardless of its permissive license, introduces a significant user-experience hurdle and may not be suitable for many consumer-facing applications. The existence of a gate fundamentally changes the deployment strategy, shifting the model from a public resource to a semi-restricted one.

### **2.3. Performance Optimization Techniques**

The feasibility and efficiency of running large language models in a web browser are heavily influenced by a range of technical optimization techniques. These methods are crucial for overcoming the inherent limitations of client-side hardware, such as constrained memory and computational resources.

One of the most impactful techniques is **quantization**, a process that reduces the numerical precision of a model's weights and activations.1 Models are typically trained using 32-bit floating-point numbers (

fp32), but for inference, their weights can be compressed into lower-precision formats like 16-bit floats (fp16) or 4-bit/8-bit integers (q4, q8).1 This reduction in precision directly translates to a smaller file size, lower memory consumption, and faster inference times.19 For instance, a small model like

DistilGPT2 can be made even more efficient through quantization, making it an ideal choice for applications where minimal download size is paramount.2 However, there is a trade-off: aggressive quantization (e.g.,

q4) can sometimes lead to a noticeable drop in accuracy on complex tasks like coding or logical reasoning, a factor that requires careful consideration during model selection.19

Beyond quantization, **architectural efficiency** plays a pivotal role. Some models are designed from the ground up to be more performant than their contemporaries, even with a similar or smaller number of parameters. A prime example is the Mistral 7B model, which incorporates novel architectural concepts such as **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)** and **Sliding Window Attention (SWA)**.8 GQA accelerates inference speed by grouping similar queries, while SWA efficiently handles long input sequences by segmenting them into overlapping windows, reducing memory requirements.7 This architectural approach allows Mistral 7B to outperform the larger Llama 2 13B on various benchmarks, demonstrating that model design can be a more significant factor in practical performance than a raw parameter count.8 This principle challenges the conventional notion that "bigger is always better" and suggests that developers should consider a model's core architecture and its reported efficiency metrics when choosing a model for a resource-constrained environment.

### **4.2. Detailed Profiles of Top 10 Gated Models**

1. **meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf**: Meta’s Llama 2 7B model is a foundational open-source LLM that set a new performance standard upon its release. It features a doubled context length and was trained on a larger corpus of tokens compared to its predecessor.42 This model, along with its siblings, is gated on the Hugging Face Hub, requiring users to log in and accept Meta's license to download the files.4 It is a powerful model that requires a developer to account for the access gate in their deployment strategy.  
2. **google/gemma-2b**: Google's Gemma 2B is an important model for its size and vendor pedigree, but it presents a cautionary tale about the gap between official claims and real-world performance. The model is described as a "lightweight, state-of-the-art open model".5 However, community feedback is surprisingly negative, with users reporting it as "garbage," "unusable," and prone to generating garbled or nonsensical responses.44 In a direct test, the 7B version could not even correctly list US presidents, making factual recall a significant weakness.44  
3. **meta-llama/Llama-3-8B-Instruct**: A more recent entry from Meta, this model offers enhanced capabilities and strong performance in complex tasks.45 However, its rollout was reportedly "half-baked," with community members experiencing challenges with fine-tuning, tokenizers, and GGUF conversion.46 One subjective evaluation found that the model performed poorly in a long-context "needle in a haystack" task compared to Phi-3-mini, suggesting potential weaknesses that may not appear in traditional benchmarks.45

It is positioned for strong reasoning in code, math, and logic, but its larger size and gated access require a more deliberate selection process.47  
10. **microsoft/Phi-3-small-8k-instruct**: As the intermediate model in the Phi-3 family, this 7B model offers a compelling balance of size and performance.48 It is designed to be a strong competitor in the crowded 7B parameter space, providing a capable alternative to models like Mistral and Llama, particularly for developers who have a positive view of the Phi-3 series' approach to data quality and efficiency.26

## **V. Comparative Analysis and Strategic Insights**

### **5.1. The Performance Triad: Size, Speed, and Accuracy**

The selection of an ideal model for in-browser deployment is a delicate balancing act involving size, speed, and accuracy. The data reveals that a model's raw parameter count is an incomplete metric for predicting its performance in a browser environment. While it is true that larger models generally possess more capacity for complex tasks, architectural innovations and optimization techniques can radically alter this relationship.

For instance, the **Mistral 7B** model, with 7.3 billion parameters, is widely acknowledged for its ability to outperform the **Llama 2 13B** model, which has nearly twice the parameters.8 This superior performance is directly attributed to Mistral AI's implementation of novel features like Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and Sliding Window Attention (SWA), which enhance inference speed and memory efficiency. This example demonstrates that model architecture and training strategies can have a more profound impact on practical performance than sheer size alone. For developers, this implies that filtering models solely by parameter count is an insufficient heuristic. A smaller, well-architected model can often be a far superior choice for a resource-constrained environment than a larger, less-optimized one.

Furthermore, the introduction of WebGPU has fundamentally changed the performance landscape for client-side inference. While older, WASM-based backends were primarily CPU-focused, WebGPU enables browsers to leverage the full power of a user's GPU, leading to drastic speed improvements. One community member reported speed-ups of 40-75 times for embedding models on high-end hardware, and even 4-20 times on older, integrated graphics.40 This hardware acceleration makes it possible to run much larger models, such as Llama-3.1-70B, directly in the browser, provided the user has a powerful machine.40 However, this capability comes with a trade-off: larger models still require significant initial download and memory allocation, which can limit their viability for a general-purpose public website.38

### **5.2. The Divergence of Benchmarks and User Sentiment**

A significant finding from the analysis is the critical disconnect between how some models are presented in official benchmarks and their reception within the developer community. This is most apparent in the case of Google's **Gemma** models. While these models are officially described as "state-of-the-art" and high-performing on benchmarks 5, community feedback on platforms like Reddit paints a starkly different picture. Users have consistently labeled Gemma models as "garbage" and "unusable," reporting issues such as garbled responses, confident but incorrect answers, and an inability to handle basic factual recall tasks.44 For example, a user noted that the 7B model failed to list US presidents correctly, a task easily handled by other models of similar size.44

This disparity suggests that a model's performance on a curated set of academic benchmarks may not accurately reflect its real-world utility. Benchmarks can be susceptible to overfitting, where a model is fine-tuned to excel on a narrow range of test cases without improving its general-purpose capabilities. In contrast, community discussions reflect the outcome of testing these models on a wide array of uncurated, real-world prompts, providing a more reliable and honest assessment of their practical strengths and weaknesses. The implication for developers is clear: official performance metrics should not be the sole basis for model selection. Due diligence must include a thorough review of community feedback to ensure a model is reliable and fit for purpose, particularly for applications where factual accuracy and coherent output are critical.

### **5.3. Licensing, Ethical Considerations, and a Hybrid Approach**

The choice of an in-browser LLM is also intertwined with broader considerations of licensing and application architecture. For developers, open-source licenses like MIT and Apache 2.0 offer the most flexibility, allowing for broad commercial and research use without significant restrictions. However, as the analysis shows, a permissive license does not guarantee a non-gated model, requiring a developer to verify the access policy before planning their deployment.6

A sophisticated development strategy would involve a hybrid approach, leveraging the strengths of both local and remote inference. A developer could use a small, non-gated model, such as Xenova/distilgpt2 or microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, for quick, low-latency tasks like basic summarization, text classification, or content suggestion directly within the user's browser.28 This handles the vast majority of simple requests instantly, providing an excellent user experience while reducing server costs. For more complex, resource-intensive tasks that require the power of a larger model, the application can fall back to a server-side API call. This server-side model could be a larger, more capable, and potentially gated model like

Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B, leveraging its superior reasoning or multilingual capabilities.31

This tiered system maximizes performance and efficiency. It avoids the large initial download time and memory footprint of a massive model on the client side, while still providing access to powerful AI capabilities when needed. It is a pragmatic solution that balances user experience, cost-effectiveness, and model performance, offering a blueprint for how to build scalable and robust AI-powered web applications in this evolving landscape.

## **VI. Final Recommendations and Strategic Outlook**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of public LLMs on Hugging Face and their compatibility with transformers.js, a clear set of recommendations emerges for developers and researchers.

### **6.1. Strategic Model Selection Guide**

* **For Prototyping and Simple Demos:** Choose ultra-lightweight, non-gated models. The openai-community/gpt2 (17.4M) and Xenova/distilgpt2 (82M) are ideal for this purpose due to their minimal download size and instant load times, making them perfect for proof-of-concept projects and educational tools.20  
* **For General-Purpose In-Browser Chatbots:** For a balance of performance and accessibility, select a robust non-gated model. The microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct is an exceptional choice, as its performance rivals older, larger models, and it is explicitly designed for resource-constrained environments.28 The  
  mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 is another top-tier option, praised for its efficiency and strong performance on a variety of benchmarks.8  
* **For Specialized and High-Performance Tasks:** For applications requiring exceptional coding ability or nuanced multilingual understanding, prioritize models from the Qwen series. The Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B is highly regarded for its coding performance, while its larger counterparts offer more power for complex tasks.32 For demanding reasoning tasks, models like  
  microsoft/Phi-3-medium-128k-instruct (14B) with its long context window is a strong candidate, though it requires gated access.47  
* **For Enterprise and Professional Needs:** Consider a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of local and server-side processing. Use a fast, non-gated client-side model for immediate, simple tasks, while routing complex requests to a more powerful, server-based model. This approach optimizes the user experience while allowing access to cutting-edge, potentially gated, models from vendors like Meta and Microsoft for critical applications.

### **6.2. The Trajectory of Client-Side AI**

The future of client-side AI is a story of increasing capability and accessibility. The continued development of browser technologies like WebGPU will be a primary driver, dramatically accelerating inference speeds and making it possible to run models that were previously confined to powerful servers.40 This trend will empower developers to build more robust and feature-rich applications that respect user privacy by keeping data local. The existence of dedicated community organizations like Xenova that specialize in optimizing and distributing web-ready models is crucial for the health of this ecosystem.13 The growing number of models with the

transformers.js tag on the Hugging Face Hub signals a thriving and expanding field.49 As the efficiency of models improves and the performance of browser environments accelerates, the line between local and server-side AI will continue to blur, leading to a more decentralized, private, and efficient future for machine learning applications.
